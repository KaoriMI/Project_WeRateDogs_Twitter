# WeRateDog Data Analysis
This is a project to wrangle and analyse WeRateDog data.

## Introduction
WeRateDog is a Twitter account that rates people's dog with a humorous comment about the dog.
In this project, I focus on wrangling data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.

## Dataset

* <b>twitter-archive-enhaced.csv</b></br>
This is the WeRateDogs Twitter archive data which contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of thier tweets until 1 August 2017.<br>
This is provided by WeRateDog.

* <b>twitter_archive_master.csv</b></br>
I stored the clean DataFrames after cleaning twitter-archive-enhaced.csv.

* <b> tweet_json.txt</b></br>
I gathered this additional data such as each tweet's retweet count and favorite count via Twitter API.

* <b>image_prediction.tsv</b></br>
The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network.</br>

## Reports
I made the following reports.

* <b>wrangle_act</b></br>
I documented my assessment and cleaning for quality and tidiness issues on each gathered data.
Also, I analysed and visualised my wrangled data.

* <b>wrangle_report.pdf</b></br>
I created a short report that briefly describes my wrangling efforts. (This is to be framed as an internal document.)
   
* <b>act_report.pdf</b></br>
I created a short report that communicates the insights and displays the visualizations produced from my wrangled data. (This is to be framed as an external document.)
